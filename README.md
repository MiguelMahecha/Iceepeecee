# Project Name

## Description
This is a simulator for the ICPC problem ["Islands from the Sky"](https://icpc.global/worldfinals/problems/icpc2021.pdf) (page 11).

It doesn't include an interactive UI, you can run the program from the main method in the Main class. Giving it whatever input data you wish.

The simulator will then show you how it solves the problem for the given input.

This project was made by me and my classmate Felipe Calvache as part of the Object-Oriented Programming 
class we took as a part of the Systems Engineering program given by the Colombian School of Engineering Julio Garavito
